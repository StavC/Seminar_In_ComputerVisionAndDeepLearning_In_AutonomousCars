# Seminar_In_ComputerVisionAndDeepLearning_In_AutonomousCars

I have made this Seminar as part of my Computer Science degree program at the Open University :https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20372.htm

In this Seminar i reviewed the Deep Learning world from scratch so even someone that is new to the field can have a go and learn more about the world of deep learning.

i reviewed very interesting topics in the theory and concepts of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

analyzed different computer vision systems that are used in Autonomous Cars.

Added a Deep learning model that classify traffic signs.

had a Blast and cant wait to study more about Deep Learning and Computer Vision
