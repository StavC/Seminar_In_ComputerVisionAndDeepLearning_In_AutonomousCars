# Seminar_In_ComputerVisionAndDeepLearning_In_AutonomousCars

In this Seminar I reviewed the Deep Learning world from scratch,

hence even someone that is new to the field can have a go and learn more about the world of deep learning in Hebrew!

I recaped very interesting topics in the theory and concepts of Deep Learning and Computer Vision as such:

Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Activation Functions, Gradient Descent, Overfitting, Data Selection, Data Augmentation, Object Detection, Object Tracking, Image Segmentation, RCNN, Yolo, Segnet, Siamese networks.

at the end I creaeted a CNN model to classify Traffic signs with a great success.

I have made this Seminar as part of my Computer Science degree program at the Open University https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20372.htm.
